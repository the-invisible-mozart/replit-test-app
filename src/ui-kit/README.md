This folder is intended to be kept in sync with our UI Kit in Figma, any shared component
that is not a representation of the Figma UI kit should go into /src/components.

https://www.figma.com/design/oPZYnrXapaGVX1j5U82fH8/shadcn_ui-kit?node-id=580-9180&p=f&m=dev

Variants and states from the components within this folder should match Figma components, that
way we can have a streamline process when translating Design to Code.
